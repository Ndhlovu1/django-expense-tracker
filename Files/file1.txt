Psalm 23 v 1 : The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Habbakkuk 2 v 2-3 : Then the Lord answered me and said ''Write the vision and Make it plain on the tablets, that he may run who reads it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time; But at the end it will speak and it will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; Because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
Psalm 27 v 1 : The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?
